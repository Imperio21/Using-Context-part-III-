This is a project only for studies using contextApi in a simple way, but with a little advance compared to the second part, without stylization. If you want to start the project just run the command in the terminal 'npm install' or 'yarn install' to download the dependencies and then run the command 'npm start' or 'yarn start' to start.Credits to the video by youtuber HenriqueCesp.
